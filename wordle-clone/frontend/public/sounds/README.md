# Sound Effects

This directory contains the sound effects for the Wordle clone. You'll need to add the following sound files:

1. `keypress.mp3` - A short, retro-style key press sound
2. `invalid.mp3` - A buzzer or error sound for invalid words
3. `win.mp3` - A victory fanfare sound
4. `lose.mp3` - A game over sound

You can find free sound effects from these sources:

Make sure to:
1. Use short sound effects (1-2 seconds)
2. Keep file sizes small (under 100KB each)
3. Use MP3 format
4. Choose retro-style sounds that match the pixel art theme

- Key press: Short, crisp, 8-bit style
- Invalid: Quick buzz or error tone
